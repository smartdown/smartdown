<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Is this Beta Software?</strong> Not anymore. We're calling it 1.0.0 and saying it is ready for others to use. It has been in use for a couple years internally with the Smartdown team.</li>
<li><strong>Is this open source?</strong> Yes, finally. As of April 28, 2019 Smartdown has been released as open source under the BSD-3-Clause license.</li>
<li><strong>How are you going to make a living off of this?</strong> I have no idea! Smartdown is something I want to exist. I'm hoping that someone else finds it useful and that maybe there will be a way for me to keep working on it. Right now, it's a weekend and spare time project.</li>
<li><strong>How can I provide feedback?</strong> - Send an email to <a href="mailto:smartdown@quantumclay.com">smartdown@quantumclay.com</a>; any feedback is appreciated. I am working on creating a more flexible and interactive means of user feedback.</li>
<li><strong>What is InfoClay?</strong> InfoClay is the name of an interactive authoring environment wherein Smartdown was initially conceived, and then isolated as a separate library. InfoClay is still under development as <a href="https://knowbench.com">KnowBench</a>, but my priorities have been on stabilizing and releasing Smartdown. In some of the earlier documentation and examples, InfoClay and Smartdown mean the same thing: markdown-based, interactive, reactive explorable explanations.</li>
