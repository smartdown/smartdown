### MadLibs

The idea behind using [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) as a teaching tool is that it is a potentially fun way to enable students to *create* a simple program that they can show-and-tell, all without requiring any of the tedium of programming other than minor syntax. The basic idea is that a teacher provides the students with an example, like the one below, and the students are encouraged to adapt and share their own MadLib for their friends and fellow students to play with.

At a deeper level, MadLibs provide an easy way to understand the concepts of *substitution* and *data type*. The Parts of Speech correspond to data types in a programming language, although there is no need to point this out to students in the first lesson.
